              <p>Often called the largest cat of all times, the American lion or Panthera atrox, is probably the best known of all prehistoric cats after Smilodon. It lived in both North and South America (from Alaska to Peru) during the Pleistocene epoch, and went extinct 11,000 years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age. Most scientists believe that the American Lion was a gigantic relative to modern lions, perhaps even belonging to the same species (in which case the correct name would be Panthera leo atrox). However, others are not so sure, and suggest that the American lion, although closely related to the lion, was a separate species and probably looked quite different on the outside. Recently, it was suggested that the American lion was probably more similar to the jaguar.One thing is certain; the American lion was the largest cat in North America during the Ice Age, weighing up to 470 (1036lbs), perhaps even 500 kgs (1102lbs), and being able to take on very large prey. There is still some debate about its hunting technique, for although modern day lions hunt in groups, American lion remains are scarce, suggesting that these cats were probably solitary hunters. This would make sense if we consider that the North American Smilodon fatalis, a species of sabertooth, was seemingly a pack hunter. By hunting alone and preying on different animals, it may be that the American lion avoided competition with the sabertooth, explaining why both cats coexisted successfully for such a long time.</p>
