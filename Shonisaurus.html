              <p>Shonisaurus was among the strangest of all ichthyosaurs ("fish lizards"), looking a bit like a cross between a dolphin and a whale with its thick, round body, long, narrow front and rear flippers, pointed mouth with teeth only on the front end, and double-pronged tail. At upwards of 50 feet long and 30 tons, this was one of the biggest animals on the planet during the late Triassic period, matched in size only by the giant marine reptiles and fish that lived tens of millions of years later, notably Liopleurodon and Leedsichthys. Like other ichthyosaurs, Shonisaurus is believed to have evolved from land-dwelling lizards that returned to an aquatic lifestyle during the early Triassic period. That makes this family of marine reptiles roughly analogous to modern dolphins and whales, which also evolved from smaller, land-dwelling ancestors. (By the way, Shonisaurus is the state fossil of land-locked Nevada, which was submerged beneath a shallow body of water during much of the Mesozoic Era.). Shonisaurus lived during the Norian stage of the late Triassic period. S. popularis measured around 15 metres (49 ft) long. A second species from British Columbia was named Shastasaurus sikanniensis in 2004. S. sikkanniensis was one of the largest marine reptiles of all time, measuring 21 metres (69 ft). However, phylogenetic studies later showed S. sikanniensis to be a species of Shastasaurus rather than Shonisaurus. Shonisaurus had a long snout, and its flippers were much longer and narrower than in other ichthyosaurs. While Shonisaurus was initially reported to have had socketed teeth (rather than teeth set in a groove as in more advanced forms), these were present only at the jaw tips, and only in the very smallest, juvenile specimens. All of these features suggest that Shonisaurus may be a relatively specialised offshoot of the main ichthyosaur evolutionary line. It was historically depicted with a rather rotund body, but studies of its body shape since the early 1990s have shown that the body was much more slender than traditionally thought. S. popularis had a relatively deep body compared with related marine reptiles.[1] Shonisaurus was also traditionally depicted with a dorsal fin, a feature found in more advanced ichthyosaurs. However, other shastasaurids likely lacked dorsal fins, and there is no evidence to support the presence of such a fin in Shonisaurus. The upper fluke of the tail was probably also much less developed than flukes found in later species.</p>
