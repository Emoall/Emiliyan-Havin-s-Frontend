              <p>Sarcosuchus is also known as the SuperCroc. The name Sarcosuchus is Greek for "flesh crocodile," but that apparently wasn't impressive enough for the producers at National Geographic. This cable channel bestowed the title "SuperCroc" on its hour-long documentary about Sarcosuchus, a name that has since stuck in the popular imagination. (By the way, there are other "crocs" in the prehistoric bestiary, including BoarCroc and DogCroc.) Sarcosuchus was technically a "pholidosaur." Its nickname aside, the SuperCroc wasn't really a crocodile at all, but rather a type of prehistoric reptile known as a "pholidosaur." (By contrast, the almost-as-big Deinosuchus genuinely was in the crocodile family, though it was technically an alligator.) The crocodile-like pholidosaurs have long since gone extinct, and haven't left any direct living descendants. The snout of Sarcosuchus was unusually narrow. Aside from its gigantic size, the SuperCroc was characterized by its unusually long, narrow skull, which measured almost six feet from neck to snout (or about the height of an average human being). A full three-quarters of this length was taken up by Sarcosuchus' jaws, which were studded with no less than 132 teeth (which, by the way, weren't very sharp) The bulbous depression, or "bulla," at the end of Sarcosuchus' snout continues to be a mystery to paleontologists. It may have been a sexually selected characteristic (that is, males with larger bullas were more attractive to females), an enhanced olfactory organ, or even a sounding chamber that allowed members of the species to communicate with each other over long distances.Sarcosuchus kept growing throughout its life span. Unlike modern crocodiles, which attain their adult size in about ten years, Sarcosuchus kept growing and growing at a steady rate (paleontologists can determine this by examining cross-sections of fossilized specimens). As a result, the largest, most superannuated SuperCrocs attained lengths of up to 40 feet, compared to about 25 feet for the largest crocodiles alive today. What made Sarcosuchus truly impressive was its dinosaur-worthy weight: almost ten tons for those 40-foot-long senior citizens described above. If the SuperCroc had lived after the dinosaurs had gone extinct, rather than during the middle Cretaceous period 100 million years ago, it would have been one of the largest terrestrial creatures on the face of the earth. Sarcosuchus probably subsisted on fish. You'd think a crocodile as big and heavy as Sarcosuchus would have feasted on the plus-sized dinosaurs of its habitat--say, a hadrosaur that wandered too close to the river for a drink. Judging by the shape of its snout, though, it's likely that the SuperCroc ate fish exclusively (gigantic theropods equipped with similar snouts, like Spinosaurus, also enjoyed piscivorous diets). Although it's unlikely that Sarcosuchus hunted dinosaurs for lunch, there's no reason it had to tolerate other predators that competed with it for limited resources. A full-grown SuperCroc would have been more than capable of breaking the neck of a large theropod, such as, say, the contemporary, fish-eating Spinosaurus. The eyes of Sarcosuchus rolled up and down, not left and right. You can tell a lot about a creature's daily behavior by observing the shape, structure, and placement of its eyes. The eyes of Sarcosuchus didn't move left and right, like those of a cow or panther, but rather up and down, indicating that the SuperCroc spent much of its time submerged partway below the surface of freshwater rivers, scanning the banks for interlopers. Sarcosuchus lived in northern Africa. One hundred million years ago, northern Africa was a lush, tropical region crisscrossed by numerous rivers; it's only relatively recently (geologically speaking) that this area dried out and became overspread by the Sahara Desert. Sarcosuchus was only one of a wide variety of plus-sized reptiles that took advantage of this continent's natural abundance, though it was certainly one of the biggest!</p>
